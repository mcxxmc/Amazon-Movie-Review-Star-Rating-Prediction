Task description: (from the class kaggle page)

The goal of this competition is to predict the star rating associated with user reviews from Amazon Movie Reviews using the available features.
You are allowed to use any technique used in class for your predictions, as well as classical machine learning algorithms, like random forests, regression trees, etc. Using deep learning models, or any other related technique, that lies far from what we have covered so far in this class is prohibited. What we mainly seek from this competition - besides performance- is smart and creative ways of making sense of the data, quality construction of new features from the available data, and a thought procedure that indicates a deep understanding of the concepts covered so far.
